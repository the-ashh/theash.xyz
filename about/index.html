    so, how are you? most of the time, i go by cooler9711. i do some coding stuff and really want to learn swift, but AP classes take up so much time.
  </p>
  <p>
    the/a career that i really want is security researcher. i already have a little mini write-up of taking over a domain <a href="https://github.com/cooler9711/vulnerable-to-takeover" class="hvr-grow-shadow">here</a>. that was actually pretty fun to figure out.
  </p>
  <p>
    so, i'm doing <a class="hvr-grow-shadow" href="https://codein.withgoogle.com">google code-in</a> and that's pretty fun. i've already won my t-shirt so woooo.
